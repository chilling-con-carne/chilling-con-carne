                    <p class="mb-6">As is common practice with almost all professional websites this site
                    uses cookies, which are tiny files that are downloaded to your 
                    computer, to improve your experience. This page describes what 
                    information they gather, how we use it and why we sometimes need to 
                    store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these 
                    cookies from being stored however this may downgrade or 'break' certain 
                    elements of the sites functionality.</p>
                    <p class="font-bold mb-6"><strong>How We Use Cookies</strong></p>
                    <p class="mb-6">We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately
                    in most cases there are no industry standard options for disabling 
                    cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they
                    add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if 
                    you are not sure whether you need them or not in case they are used to 
                    provide a service that you use.</p>

                            <p>From time to time we test new features and make subtle changes to the

                            these cookies may be used to ensure that you receive a consistent

                    mentioned if there is something that you aren't sure whether you need or
                    not it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does 
                    interact with one of the features you use on our site.</p>
